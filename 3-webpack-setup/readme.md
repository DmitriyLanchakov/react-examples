# WebPack Setup

A simple example of using WebPack to compile ES6/7 React code into ES5 that runs in any modern web browser.

You can run WebPack with the `build` npm script: `npm run build`

This generates a compiled version of the code in `index.js` into the file `build.js`.

We use a few Babel presets in order to support React and other ES6/7 syntax.
